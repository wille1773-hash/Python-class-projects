# COP3502C Python Projects

Curated bundle of my COP3502 assignments and small projects. Each subfolder has its own README with what it does, how to run it, and what I learned. Highlighted first: the team-built final project.

- `0_final_project_sudoku/` – Pygame Sudoku with board/cell model and puzzle generator. Led a small team: split gameplay UI, board logic, and generator workstreams; integrated and tested together.
- `blackjack_p1/` – Intro blackjack sim using provided PRNG; tracks win/loss stats.
- `blackjack_casino/` – Enhanced blackjack with multi-deck shoe, soft-17 dealer logic, and statistics.
- `rle_image_encoder/` – Run-length encoding CLI with hex/RLE conversions and console image viewer.
- `pakudex_cli/` – Menu-driven creature tracker (add/list/show/evolve/sort).
- `calc_utils/` – Calculator functions with pytest coverage.
- `whack_a_mole/` – Pygame whack-a-mole grid game.
- `cow_talk/` – Cowsay-style ASCII animals with variants.
- `extra_credit_tickets/` – Ticket pricing flow with validation.

How to use:
1) `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` (or use your Python env).
2) For Pygame projects: `pip install pygame`.
3) See each subfolder README for commands, inputs, and notes.
